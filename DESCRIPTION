Description: S-curve modeling can sometimes be a difficult process to under go.
  This package assists in developing preparing the data for s-curve modeling and
  working with the results of the model. After following a step by step process,
  the package will create a lookup table and a coefficient table. The lookup 
  table will contain the x and y values of the s-curve model. The coefficient 
  table will contain a list of expected coefficients based on the provided data.
